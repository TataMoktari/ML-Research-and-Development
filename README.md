# ML-Research-and-Development (will continue to update the description section)
🧠 Project Overview
This repository demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a machine learning model in a complete end-to-end pipeline. It covers every stage of the machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and scoring on new data.

📦 Pipeline Highlights \
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\
🧹 Feature Engineering & Selection\
⚙️ Model Training & Validation\
📈 Performance Evaluation\

🚀 Model Deployment (Optional)\

🎯 Purpose\
The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience for building robust ML pipelines that are production-ready and reproducible.
